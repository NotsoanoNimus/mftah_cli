This application encrypts or decrypts MFTAH payloads provided either by STDIN or by a
   file path. It then pipes the mutated content to either STDOUT or to a destination file.

USAGE:
   Encrypt:  mftahcrypt -ek 'superPassword!' -i /mnt/usb/mydisk.img -o mydisk.mftah
   Decrypt:  mftahcrypt -dK ~/.payload_pass <payload.mftah >payload.img
   Stream:   dd if=/path/to/500GiB-mftah | mftahcrypt -sdK ~/keyfile.bin -o ~/out.img

OPTIONS:
   -h,--help       Shows this usage information.
   -q,--query      Query the target for more information. If a password is not supplied,
                    only minimal information will be returned. Does not work with
                    streaming mode.
   -d,--decrypt    Specifies that the application should decrypt input data.
   -e,--encrypt    Specifies that the application should encrypt input data.
   -s,--stream     Indicates that the operation should take place on streamed I/O
                    only. This is useful for very large payloads that would not fit in
                    the system's available memory, or for input payloads with an unknown
                    size at the time of reading (such as incoming network data).
   --stream-factor Advanced option. Sets the buffer size factor for streamed encryption.
                    This value must be an integer between 1 and 16, inclusive. Acts as
                    a scalar value -> stream_factor x 16 MiB. Defaults to %d.
   -o,--output     Writes the operation's output to the given file path. When not
                    provided, STDOUT is used as the default.
   -i,--input      Specifies a file to read from for the operation. When not provided,
                    STDIN in used as the default.
   -k,--key        A key string to use for encryption or decryption.
                    When decrypting, this is the CURRENT key of the target.
   -K,--keyfile    A path to a binary file acting as the raw key to use.
                    When decrypting, this is the CURRENT key file of the target.
   -F,--force-key  For encryption only. Force acceptance of a given key, bypassing all
                    key constraints. A null/empty key will still be invalid.
   -t,--threads    For encryption only. Specify how many parallel threads should be used
                    to encrypt the data. Defaults to %d; maximum of %d.
   -a,--algorithm  For encryption only. Specify the predefined MFTAH crypto suite to use
                    for slicing and protecting the input payload. Valid options are
                    "chacha20" and "aes256cbc". Defaults to "chacha20".
   -n,--noninteractive
                   Runs the operation in a non-interactive mode. This will perform
                    the crypto operation without any confirmations, such as overwriting
                    destination file paths. Use with caution.
   -l,--limit      Non-streaming mode only. Specify memory limits for fixed-length payloads,
                    in units of MiB. Defaults to %d MiB.
   -v,--version    Print version information and exit.
